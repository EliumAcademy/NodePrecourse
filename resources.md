Javascript Basics  
  - [Chapter 1](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) of You Don't Know JS.  Great introduction to programming and the basics of Javascript not covered in 'Practical Javascript'.
  - [Simplify Javascript](https://github.com/GeorgeFourikis/Simplify-JavaScript) - a refrence of the examples and concepts Gordon introduces, made for you personally by George.  

Being a Developer
  - [A little long](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer), but worth every word.
  
Staying Motivated
  - Be bad at something, it's [good for you](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about).
  
 Study [smarter](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g?t=297), not harder!
