## Hello Elium Students!

Welcome to our living precourse.  We'll be updating this document regularly so be sure to stop by often for bits of humor (we think), helpful tips and fresh study resources.  Feel free to send us anything you think we missed, or fork and send us a pull request!

There are a few things you should do to be prepared for the first week, checkit ->

1. _Keep in touch!  Along with a link to this repostory you’ll have received an invitation to the Elium Community’s Slack channel.  Talk to each other!  Ask coding questions, find a room mate to same some $$$, as us any questions you have._
2. _Complete Practical Javascript through version 6. Gordon has put together an outstanding introduction to good coding and development - these are the hardest skills to learn and the most fundamental. We'll be using the code you complete as a foudnation for the first projects so come prepared!_
3. _Write code every day. Check out this famous article by the inventor of JQuery for some motivation._
4. _keep a learning journal using this website.  Each day answer these questions in one sentance or a short list:_ 
 	* what you will work on today 
	* what you acomplished	
	* what you struggled with	
	* what you’ll work on tomorrow. 
5. _If you finish the WatchAndCode, start studying the development environment; Sublime, Chrome Console, Command line, Git and Github (check out the resources section for more info).  We'll be exploring this in the first week, the more prepared you are the more you'll learn!_

In the first days we'll be meeting with each of you individually to go over the work you completed in the precourse and to set personalized objectives.  BE PREPARED

We look forward to seeing you soon. in the mean time, keep in touch!

love from The Elium Team
