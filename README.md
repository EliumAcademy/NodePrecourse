## Hello Elium Students!

Welcome to our living precourse.  We'll be updating this document regularly so be sure to stop by often for bits of humor (we think), helpful tips and fresh study resources.  Feel free to ask for more resources on any topic or let us know if we missed anything!

The best way to succeed is to do a little every day, even just one video!  Check out this motivational [article](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.  This [website](https://codehalf.com) is a great tool for keeping yourself on track.  

Get yourself set up on slack, then work your way through the precourse following the sections in order.  

Be sure to keep in touch!
