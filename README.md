## Hello Elium Students!

Welcome to our living precourse.  We'll be updating this document regularly so be sure to stop by often for bits of humor (we think), helpful tips and fresh study resources.  Feel free to ask for more resources on any topic or let us know if we missed anything!


To prepare for the program, follow the [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) tutorial through version 6.   
You may find these resources to be helpful:  
	
1. [Simplify Javascript](https://github.com/GeorgeFourikis/Simplify-JavaScript) - a refrence of the examples and concepts Gordon introduces, made for you personally by George.   
2. [CheatSheet JS](https://github.com/gordonmzhu) - an accompanying document made by Gordon himself.

The best way to succeed is to do a little every day, even just one video!  Check out this motivational [article](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.  This [website](https://codehalf.com) is a great tool for keeping yourself on track.

Be sure to keep in touch!
