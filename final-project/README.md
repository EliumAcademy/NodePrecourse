Finished code isn't a finished project.  Navigable and helpful github repositories are finished projects.
  
After finishing Practical Javascript, create a new app of your own.  This project will not be a todo app, but it will follow the same development steps as PJS and it will support the same user interactions.     
  
Apps are programs which allow users to interact with some set of data.  defined:  
  * Apps = data + interaction 
  
Your final project will have different data (ie. a training schedule or blog posts instead of todos) and different html, but support the same type of simple user interactions (ie. toggling, deleting, creating).  
  
On the first day of class we will go over each of your apps with you individually.  If your code isn't in a complete repository we won't consider it finished.
Here's an example of a [complete repository](https://github.com/elium-student/my-first-repo).  
 
To complete this final project you will need these git skills:  
  * committing, branching, and tagging locally.
  * pushing and pulling from remote branches  
  * pushing tags to remote repos  (tags mark versions)
  * hosting a gh-pages static site  

Happy coding!
