This is how you do it:  
   * [Killer Article](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer) - long, but worth every word.  
   * Study [smarter](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g?t=297), not harder!
   * [Growth Stages of a Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qYll837a_0) - Mr Funfunfunction.  You should get to know this guy.   
   * [Be reasonable with yourself](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) - This stuff takes work, and more that, then a lot of practice.
